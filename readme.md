# Gator CLI  
**RSS feeds but make it multiplayerâ€¦ in your terminal.**  

Keep up with blogs, news sites, and podcasts â€” straight from your CLI. Add feeds, follow others, and browse aggregated posts like itâ€™s 2010 LAN party vibes, but with Postgres.  

---

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s this?  
- **Collect RSS feeds** from across the internet.  
- **Store them in PostgreSQL** â€” no servers, no cloud magic, just good old SQL.  
- **Follow / unfollow feeds** other users added (yes, itâ€™s multi-user).  
- **Browse posts in your terminal** with summaries and links.  

> âš  **Heads up:** No user-based authentication.  
> You register or log in (no passwords, itâ€™s vibes-based trust).
> Treat this like the wild west of local apps.
